			<p class="flavor">In other times and places across the multiverse, goblinkind has been touched and changed irreversibly by Maglubiyet, destined to serve at his side in Acheron. Within the confines of Aldebräis, however, they are guided by a different hand, one more preoccupied with law and order than war and conquest.</p>

			</ul>
			<h4>HOBGOBLIN TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your hobgoblin character has the following racial traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age. </em></strong>Hobgoblins mature and age at roughly the same rate as a human might, maturing around 17 and living around 65 years.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment. </em></strong>The Red Banner, and thus most hobgoblins, has a strong tendency toward strict, unforgiving law and careful planning. Most hobgoblins are naturally inclined towards Lawful Neutral, and while Lawful Good and Lawful Evil aren't uncommon, non-lawful hobgoblins are.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size. </em></strong>Hobgoblins typically stand between 5'4" - 5'10" and weigh between 150 - 200 lb. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed. </em></strong>Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you aren't slowed down by worn armour.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision. </em></strong>You can see up to 60 feet in darkness as if it was dim light, and 60 feet in dim light as if it was bright light. You can't discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages. </em></strong>You can speak, read and write Goblin and Common. In Aldebräis, Goblin is a harsh, direct language that reflects the typical bluntness of its speakers. Due to its wide vocabulary and simplicity, it's one of the most common languages in Khazan and Medona.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace. </em></strong>There are two subraces of Hobgoblin in Aldebräis; Bannerborn and Imperial. Pick one of these subraces.</p>
