		<p><em>Prerequisite: Any Lawful Alignment</em></p>
			<p>You have shown yourself to be true to your word, honest and reliable. You gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Whenever you gain 2 or more points of Honour as a reward, you gain an additional 1 point of Honour.</li>
				<li>You gain Certainty X (where X is 15 or your Honour, whichever is lower) on Intimidation and Persuasion skill checks where your Honour is involved. For example, Intimidation checks where you promise to kill someone or expose a dire secret they're trying to hide might carry more weight if your word does, as might Persuasion checks to convince someone to reveal more information about a job or provide a down payment before the job is complete. If you're unsure if this applies, discuss it with your GM.</li>
			</ul>
