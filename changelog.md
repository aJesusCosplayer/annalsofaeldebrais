# Changelog
13th October 2020:
  Created the repository and began initial testing with spells.xml. Only one spell currently - 'Storm Strike'.
  Worked out the format for .index and .xml files used in Aurora, made this supplement functional after a series of tests.
  Currently works, spell is implimented and formatted correctly. Am able to add it to characters, character sheets etc. All is good so far!
  Have begun to work on implimenting the Oath of Command for further testing. Incomplete as of now.

  Fixed minor grammar and spelling issues in background-blegion.xml

15th October 2020:
  Finished the 'Oath of Command' archetype for paladin. Tested for functionality. 
  Minor bugfixes and updates in .index file.
  Started work on the Aldebr√§is Hobgoblin race. Will likely be a WIP for a while as I write the description/s.

16th October 2020:

  Began adding all the Hunter's Gear and other items from the setting.
